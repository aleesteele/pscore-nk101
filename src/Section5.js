                    Kim Jung Un and First Lady Ri Sol Ju are the leading fashion icons in North Korea. Fashion trends are closely related to the state’s ideology.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The spread of South Korean pop culture among the people cannot be stopped. Many young North Koreans prefer to adopt South Korean hairstyles they see in the dramas or movies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Children wear crimson neckties once they become members of the chosun young pioneer corps.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Citizens are required to wear badges displaying at least one of the North Korean leaders over their hearts whenever they leave home.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The law requires every home to hang portraits of the Great Leaders Kim Il-Sung and the Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il. Inspectors pay visits to make sure the portraits are kept in good condition. If a fire breaks out in a home, saving the portraits is the first priority.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The parents and teachers of a 14 year old girl, who died while trying to save the portraits from floodwater, were given awards. If the girl did not protect the portraits, she would have been arrested and sent to prison.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Citizens are obligated to join different social organizations that run primarily for political propaganda. People are separated based on their gender, age group, job position, etc.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Adults are required to participate in regular criticism sessions where they must admit to committing some improper acts and then are criticized by other members.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The North Korean People worship the Kim family and regime out of fear, no sincerity. One popular song among North Koreans about three bears mocks the three “fat” leader.
                    <br/><br/>
                    KKotjebi is the North Korean term coined after the Korean War to describe the thousands of war orphans who roamed the streets in search of food and shelter.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Defectors are automatically given South Korean citizenship. To avoid stereotypes and discrimination, South Koreans refer to North Korean defectors as “new people”.
                    <br/><br/>
                    70% of defectors are women. Women are able to escape more easily than men because of the high demand for North Korean women in China. Many become victims of sex trafficking or are bought and sold as wives. Some women ask brokers to sell them, believing life in China under any condition would be better than life in North Korea.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The price of a cow in North Korea is about the same as one North Korean woman, depending on her age and appearance.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Brokers lie women, telling them their families sold them to China, to make them feel hopeless and keep them from going back to North Korea.
                    <br/><br/>
                    From 2002-2014, the North and South Korean governments have help family reunions to reunite family members separated by the Korean War.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Citizens must vote in national elections are they will be accused of being a reactionary. North Koreans living illegally in China risk going back to vote so their families don’t get punished. Ballots have only one option ad votes swing 100% for the leader. There is a “yes” box and  a “no” box for placing the ballots, sometimes only a “yes” box.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Patients can’t receive treatment unless they pay for their own medicine and surgical equipment, from anesthetics to pain relievers.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Hospitals use washed glass bottles in lieu of ringer lactate bottles and many people take one opium drug as a cure-all.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The military holds a dominant position in the government structure and strengthens the regime’s ability to rule firmly. The typical draft age is 17 years. Mandatory military service for all men is 10 years. Mine work given for those in bad health is 5 years.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Youth take part in milary reservist training in case of wartime mobilization. Boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 17 are trained in firing machine guns and throwing grenades. Adult males must partake in annual military drills after completing military service.
                    <br/><br/>

                    The regime publicly executes citizens for a variety of crimes like attempting to defect, watching a South Korean movie, criticizing the government and stealing food.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Most public executions are carried out by firing squad or hanging. Many prisoners are so heavily tortured they appear to be already dead before their executions. Oftentimes, whole communities, including children, are brought out to watch public executions, which are designed to instill fear among the people.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Between 80,000 and 120,000 people are currently detained in four large political prison camps. They are imprisoned without trial for political offenses. Many were not guilty of any crime but were related to someone who was.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Torture, infanticide, starvation, execution and rape are widespread. The only way out is to escape or die.

                    Sentences in labor camps are shorter than political camps but living conditions are equally bad. Prisoners work 15 hours per day and are required to attend re-education classes after work hours. If they do not meet their daily quota, they are beaten.
